# Path
```python
# for windows
from pathlib import Path

Path(r'C:\Program FIles\Microsoft')

# for linux
## 1
from pathlib import Path

path = Path('ecommerce/__init__.py')	# path = path_object: ecommerce/__init__.py, which is equivallent to ./emmerce/__init__.py

path.exists()	# does path_object exists ?
path.is_file()	# is path_object a file ?
path.is_dir()	# is path obhect a directory ?


Path.home()	# return the home directory of current user

print(path)
print(path.name)	# print the name of object pointed by path
print(path.stem)	# name = stem.suffix
print(path.suffix)
print(path.parent)	# print the parent of path_object of 'path'

path = path.with_name('init.txt')	# path = noexsisted path_object: ecommerce/init.txt

print(path)

path = path.with_suffix('.py')	# path = noexsisted path_object: ecoomerce/init.py

print(path)

# Working with Files
## basic functions
```python
from pathlib import Path
from time import ctime

path = Path('ecommerce/__init__.py')

# path.exists()					# check whether file of 'path' exists
# path.rename('ecommerce/__init__.txt')		# move the file of 'path'
# path.unlink()					# delete file of 'path'

print(ctime(path.stat().st_ctime))				# print the create_time of the path of 'path', make sure its humanable

print(path.read_text()) 	# read the text of the file of 'path', and print it
path.write_text('hello world')  # write 'hello world' into the file of 'path'
```
## copy
```python
from matplotlib import Path
import shutil


source  = Path('ecommerce/__init__.py')		# the file to copy: 'ecoomer/__init__.py',  link it to 'source'
target = Path() / '__init__.py'			# copy the file to './__iniit__.py',  link it to 'target'

shutil.copy(source, target)			# copy the file of 'source' to the path of 'target' 
```
# Working with Zip Files
## create
```python
from pathlib import Path
from zipfile import ZipFile

with ZipFile('files.zip', 'w') as zip :	# create and open './files.zip',  link it to 'zip', then close it after the followings are finished
	for path in Path('ecommerce').rglob('*.*') :	# for each file(be reffered to as 'path') in 'ecommerce' and its subpaths
		zip.write(path)				# write it into 'zip'
```
## read
```python
from pathlib import Path
from zipfile import ZipFile

with ZipFile('files.zip') as zip :		# open 'files.zip' and link it to 'zip', then close it after the followings are finished
	print(zip.namelist())	# get a list of file_names of 'zip', and print it

	info = zip.getinfo('ecommerce/__init__.py')	# get info of 'ecommerce/__init__.py' of 'zip', and link it to 'info'

	print(info.file_size)	# get the file_size of 'info', and print it
	print(info.compress_size)	# get the compress_size of 'info', and print it
	
	zip.extractall('extract')	# extract all the files of 'zip' to path: extract
```
# Woring with CSV Files
csv file: txt file for storing table information
## create
```python
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'w') as file : 	# create and open './data.csv', and link it to 'file', then close it after the fllowings are finished
	writer = csv.writer(file)	# create a writer for 'file', link it to 'writer' (you can use writer to write data into certain file)
	writer.writerow(['transactionid', 'product_id, product_number'])	# write a row into 'writer': ['transactionid', 'product_id, product_number]
	writer.writerow([1000, 1, 5])
	writer.writerow([1001, 2, 15])
```
## read
```python
import csv

with open('data.csv') as file : 	# open 'data.csv' and link it to 'file', then close it after the followings are finished
	reader = csv.reader(file)	# create a reader and read data of 'file' into the reader, and link the reader to 'reader'()
	# print(list(reader))	# convert the data of 'reader' into a list, and print it;  this code can't be used simultaneously with the following, because objects to print is all from 'reader': a reader object

	for row in reader :	# for every item(be reffered to as 'row') in 'reader' 
		print(row)	# print it
```

# Working with JSON Files
## write
```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

movies = [
		{'id':1, 'title':'Terminator', 'year':1989},
		{'id':2, 'title':'Kindergarten Cop', 'year':1993}
]

data = json.dumps(movies)	# convert 'movies' to strings represented in JSON, link it to 'data'
Path('movies,json').write_text(data)	# create './movies.json' and write txt of 'data' into it
```
## read
```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

data = Path('movies,json').read_text()	# read text of 'movies.json' and save it to 'data'

movies = json.loads(data)	# convert 'data' into Python object, and save it to 'movies'

print(movies)
print(movies[0])
print(movies[0]['title'])	# get the key value of 'title' of item 0 of 'movies', then print it
```
